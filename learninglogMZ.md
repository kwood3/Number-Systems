thing I learned 
I have learned that most if not all computer hardware uses number systems and connect to a motherboard one way or another.
Meaning for example a sound system directly connects to the motherboard via a pci port but some more basic hardware like a
webcam uses a usb that still connects to the motherboard.I have also learned how to use githubs project mode where you write 
things to do, things your doing currently for example research and things your done and github shows you how much percent completion 
you have done.


I want to learn 
Why some hardware uses binary and why some hardware uses hexadecimal.I want to learn more about the number system why 
and how they are used in software and hardware.How drivers work and connect software and hardware more indepthes.
